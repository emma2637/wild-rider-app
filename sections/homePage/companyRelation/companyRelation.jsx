Back then, asphalt roads were more the exception than the rule, the dangerous road network has been improved decade by decade.\n\nAt that time, the enduro motorcycle was the better choice. That's why we started our company as a motorcycle rental company.\nSince it was a wild time in wild surroundings, we called ourselves WILD RIDER.\n\nLittle by little, more and more 4 x 4 vehicles came into our fleet. The motorcycles have gone, the name WILD RIDER has stayed. We now offer small to medium-sized all-wheel drive vehicles for 1-5 travelers\n\nBut there are still wobbly suspension bridges, landslides, tropical heavy rain, fog banks, missing road markings and missing  safety barriers. And there is always a little war going on in the streets. The polite Ticos become egoists in traffic.\nThat is why all of our customers receive in-depth training on the condition of the roads and the corresponding rules of conduct. Our customers leave the rental station well prepared.",

They have leasing agreements with banks and car financiers.
