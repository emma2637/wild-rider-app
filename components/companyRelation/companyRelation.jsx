            longDescription: "We started our business in the 90's when tourism in Costa Rica was in its infancy. Mobility became our business field. Back then, asphalt roads were more the exception than the rule, the dangerous road network has been improved decade by decade.<br /><br />At that time, the enduro motorcycle was the better choice. That's why we started our company as a motorcycle rental company.<br />Since it was a wild time in wild surroundings, we called ourselves WILD RIDER.<br /><br />Little by little, more and more 4 x 4 vehicles came into our fleet. The motorcycles have gone, the name WILD RIDER has stayed. We now offer small to medium-sized all-wheel drive vehicles for 1-5 travelers<br /><br />But there are still wobbly suspension bridges, landslides, tropical heavy rain, fog banks, missing road markings and missing  safety barriers. And there is always a little war going on in the streets. The polite Ticos become egoists in traffic.<br />That is why all of our customers receive in-depth training on the condition of the roads and the corresponding rules of conduct. Our customers leave the rental station well prepared.",

Unfortunately this is not the case. They are licensees. They have to pay around 15% of fees and commissions to the parent company. This is not their own money, but your money. They have leasing agreements with banks and car financiers. This money, too, has to be paid by you, the customer.<br />As a family business, we work with lower overheads and can therefore offer cheaper rental prices.<br /></br />But why are you more expensive than these big companies?<br>We are never more expensive, but our offer is always honest and with no hidden costs.",
